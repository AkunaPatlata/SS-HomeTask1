# This is my first task from SoftServe and i'll try to describe what i've done in this project

# What is this project about?

This project is about me, on the `about-me` page you could see two cards that have my photos and some information about me. 
In the `home` page you can see 3 cards and if you'll change your device or change your browsers screen width you will see its responsiveness.
In the `edit` page you can add some more information about me to the cards you saw in `about-me` page. It uses NGXS to save and than load your sentence into these cards.
